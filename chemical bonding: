the force between two atom is known as chemical bonding:
cause of chemical bonding: here every compound wants to achive stability so that is known as chemical bonding: or ypu can say they want to achive noble gas configuration:

Noble gas: they are inert gas who are stable and they do not take part in reaction because there outermost shell is complete and stable:
eg: he ne ar kr xe rd

and one important thing: every compound wants to achive stability or you can say they want to achive lower potential enertgy thats why:

** Ionic bond:
 here ionic bond is an electrostaic force between the compound or the chemical reaction in between :
it happens between metals and non metals:
they are very hard and crystal:
here metal loose electron and non metal attracts electron to achive or complete there octet:
na + cl = nacl:
here electrostatic force is strong thats why they are having high melting and boiling point:
they conduct electricity: only in molten or disoolved state:

Eg:Nacl, MgO , CaO:

Electrostatic force= F = K.q1.q2/ r^2 here q1 and q2 id charge and r is the square of distance between them and k is electrostatic force constant and here value 9* 10^9 nm2


  **Lattice energy: it is the energy that is relaesed when ionic compound get formed this is known as latice energy:
   eg: here Na+ cl- compund they both get combined together to form the compund in soolid form so some amount of energy gets realesd then tghis is known as lattice energy:

*** here if the energy is relaesed then its exothermic and total will be given negative sign:
**** and if we give energy from outside to breeak the bond then this is endothermic and here overall will be positive:

** to get the lattice energy in we will use born habber cycle here because there is no direct method to calculate lattice energy here:

**Born habber cycle: it used to calculate and gets lattice enrgy:

**Enthalphy: or heat of formation: it is the amount of energy relared when 1 mole of compund is formed from its stable and pure state:

** ionistation energy: here the amount of enrgy given to help them remove the outermost electron or help themto gain the elactron is known as ionistation energy:
** sublimation energy: solid to gas conversion what amount of energy required is known as sublimation enefgy:

** factors affecting the lattice energy:
* here the greater the charge on ions: greater will be lattice energy:
* if simze will be small then lattice energy will be more as it is inversely proprtinol to distance  of distance

** cations: here cations means when an will loose electrons it will achive th estable state so when it will loose then it is aclled cations:
** anions: here when electron gains it then it will be negative so it is known as anions:

**Fazans rule: covalent character of ionic bond:
covalent mean: the sharing of electron is known as covalent:
ionic bond: means transfer of electrons:

** here the covalent nature of ionic bond is because of polarization here when cations and anions both are there so in ionic compound towrsd the pole they get more tillted this is known as covalnt charcate of ionic bons:

* polrisation: power of cations:
   * here the smaller the size larger will be polrising power:
   * if we will talk about charge of cation so here the larger the charge will be larger the polrisin power
  size:
    li> na> k> rb
    be> mg>cr>sr
  charge:
   Na<mg<al
     k<ca:

  ** if i am having pusdo noble gas configuration then covalent character will be increased:


  * anion polristaion:
     size: here the larger the size polrisation will be more and covalent charcater will be more :
     hire charge hire polrisation:
