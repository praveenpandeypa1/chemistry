chemical reaction means here chemical reacts with each other to produce the new chemical:
EG: here hydrogen react with oXYGEN to form water under certain temprature and condition:

** equation: representation of these chemicals means reactants and product in the form of symbol and formula then this is known as chemical equation:

** balancing of equation: here total mass of reactant should be equal to the total mass of products :
to prevent the law of consrvation of energy:

** quicklime in water:
CaO+ H2O= Ca(OH)2+ heat:
here reaction is exothermic,water is added slowly and it is used to make cement:

**Endothermic: here temprature is absorn from sorroundinh so it is endothermic: like melting of ice, evaporation, photosynthese:
** exothermic: here temprature is relaesed to outside so it is exothermic: like buring of fossil fuels and so on:

** quicklime= CaO:
  **slacked lime: Ca(OH)2

  white wash wall:
here we put coating Ca(OH)2 on wall and then it absorb Co2 from sorrounding and thats why the wall become shiny atlast:
caoh2+ co2= caco3+ h20
  here slacked lime combine with corbon di oxide with calcium carbonate and water:

** combination reaction : it is type of reaction in which two or more chemical combine together to form single result is known as combination reaction:
eg: hydrogen+ oxygen= water:

** decomposistion:
  here big chemical breaks down smaller one :
AB= A+B:
  quick lime used in making cement:
CACO3= CAO+CO2
  here quick lime is CaO:

** for decomposing any of the chemical reaction we need energy that energy can be:
i)heat energy:   thermal decompostion
ii)electric energy: electrolytic decomposition:
iii)light(photochemical energy): photodecompostion:

** thermal decomposition: here when we heat the chemical reaction it gets broken into diff diff form 
eg: FESO4= FE2SO3+SO2+SO3
  FESO4= FERROSU SULPHATE:
  FE2SO3=FERRIC OXIDE:

  HERE ferrous sulphate are green in colour and when you heat they will break in ferric oxide and leter so2 and so3 are gas pollutants gas:
** so its thermal decompostion and Endothermic reaction:


** electrolysys:
here the process of decompostion using electric current thats why it is called electrolysis:
h20= h2+o so here h2 goes to cathode and o2 gose to anode

**oxidation: if any chemical reaction gains oxygen then it is called oxidation and loose hydrogen :
** reduction: if any chemical reaction loose oxygen and gains hydrogen it is reduction:
** redox reaction: reaction in which oxidation and reduction happen is said to be redox:

** corosion: when metal is atcaked by its sorrounding element such as moisture and water vapour then it is said to be corrode and process is said as corroison:
** rusting of iron: iron+ oxygen+ h20= corroison

  ** ranidity: when the taste of eating food material gets changed then it is said as rancidity:
   oxidation of fat and oil material cause rancidity:

** chemical change:
whenver chemical reaction will happen then new prodcut will be fromed or diffrent chemical product and of diffrent shape and size an so on:
