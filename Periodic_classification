peiodic classifcation means putting the element with similar charcaterstics together in single row and column is knwon as periodic classification: the grouping and all these form is known as periodic classification:

** Mnadleve periodic table:
When elements are arranged in increasing atomic mass, elements with similar properties repeat at regular intervals. so it was based on atomic masses not on atomic no:

features:
| Feature                   | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Basis of arrangement      | Atomic mass                                 |
| Total elements            | 63                                          |
| Periods (horizontal rows) | 7                                           |
| Groups (vertical columns) | 8 main groups (I to VIII)                   |
| Sub-groups                | Each group had **A & B** sub-groups         |
| Gaps                      | Left blank spaces for undiscovered elements |

** achivemnst of mandelve:
1) prediction of few element that they will exits in future and leave the blank space for them aka silicon : germanium, eka- boron= scandium:
2)corrected atomic masses: eg Berrylium:
3) elemet with similar property came in same group:

**Drawbacks:
| Point                | Explanation                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Based on atomic mass | Modern table uses atomic **number**, not mass                        |
| Position of isotopes | Isotopes not explained (same element, different masses)              |
| Hydrogen position    | Hydrogen didn’t fit clearly (Group 1 or 17?)                         |
| Anomalous pairs      | Some elements placed wrong due to atomic mass rule e.g., **Co & Ni** |

Example:
| Element | Atomic Mass | Position Issue |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Co      | 58.9        | Came before Ni |
| Ni      | 59.0        | Came after Co  |

**Summary:
| Topic            | Key Point                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Periodic Law     | Atomic mass basis                     |
| Predictive Power | Very successful                       |
| Groups           | 8 (A & B)                             |
| Periods          | 7                                     |
| Major drawback   | Couldn't explain isotopes & anomalies |

Newlands law of octave:
When elements are arranged in increasing order of atomic mass, every eighth element has properties similar to the first, like musical octaves.
This means:
Element 1 and 8 are similar,
2 and 9 are similar, etc., just like Sa–Re–Ga–Ma–Pa–Dha–Ni–Sa 🎶

**Achivements:
| Point                                                   | Benefit |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ✔ First to arrange elements in order of **atomic mass** |         |
| ✔ Found periodicity in chemical properties              |         |
| ✔ Basis for later periodic tables                       |         |

Limitation
| Problem                                                  | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ❌ Worked only till Calcium (Ca)                          |             |
| ❌ After Ca, elements didn't follow 8th pattern           |             |
| ❌ Newlands tried to fit **two elements in one position** |             |
| ❌ Didn’t leave gaps for **new elements**                 |             |
| ❌ Did not work for **transition elements**               |             |


**Modern periodic table:
The physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.
📌 Atomic number (Z) = Number of protons in an atom
(Mendeleev used atomic mass; modern uses atomic number)
