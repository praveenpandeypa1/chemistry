Atom is the smallest part of matter that can not be divided further or you can say that is the smallest unit of mattern known till today:
Atom was first disciverd in india by indian scientist name as maharshi kanad: in 500 BC:
and he called it as PARMANU:

Modern day defination of ATOM:
it is the smallest part which may or may not be independenet but take part in chemical reaction is known as atom:
an atom can not be deivided by chemical reaction or methods:
atom are nearly sphere in shape:
it can not be seen even under high power microscope they are so small"

* One iron nail nearly consist of 10^23 atom:
the radius of atom is measured in nanometer:
and here 1 nanometer is 10^-9 meter:

** LAW OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION: it was given by the name of scintist anotonieo l Lvaisor:
this is law is divided into two parts:
1) law of conservation of Mass"
2) Law of constant of Proprtion:

1)Law of conservation of Mass:
it can nor be created nor be destryoed:
eg: hyderofen + oxygen = water so sum of rectation= sum of products:

2)Law of constant proprtion:
here them amount of proprtion or substance present in any of the compound is always same no matter what the amount is every time it is constant:
eg: if water consist of 1:8 of hyderogen and oxygen so this will be in every case weahther the solution is of 16 or 9 or any:


**John dalton atomic theory:
according to john dalton atomic theory matter is made up of tiny particle called atom:
and his whole law was based on law of conservation of energy and law of constant or definite proption and he was the one who give one proper deffination for this:
his atomic theory was based on law of chemical combination:

Drawbacks of dalton theory:
1) atom are indivisble according to dalton but we know it is divisble as you can see in nuclear reaction:
2)all the atons of given element have same mass but today we know they are having diffrent masses- ISOTOPES:
2)all the atoms have diffrent mass for diffrent element but now we know even atom of diffrent element can have same mass -ISOBARS:

** Internationo union of pure and applied chemistry:

**Molecule:
when two diffrent element or atom combine together and form something then this is known as Molecule:
eg: hyderogen + oxygen= water:
eg: carbon + oxygeb = carbon di- oxide:

there are some molecule that are made up of same type of atom that is known as molecule also:
eg: H2 , O2:

*Atomicity: how many no of attoms are there this is known as atomcity:
here below is the example of atomicity so you just count the no of atom combined to make that molecule so this is atom:
| Molecule        | Formula | Number of Atoms | Atomicity     |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Oxygen          | O₂      | 2               | 2 (diatomic)  |
| Nitrogen        | N₂      | 2               | 2 (diatomic)  |
| Ozone           | O₃      | 3               | 3 (triatomic) |
| Water           | H₂O     | 3 (2H + 1O)     | 3             |
| Ammonia         | NH₃     | 4 (1N + 3H)     | 4             |
| Methane         | CH₄     | 5 (1C + 4H)     | 5             |
| Sulphur (solid) | S₈      | 8               | 8 (octatomic) |


Based on atomicity:

| Type         | Atomicity | Example    |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Monoatomic   | 1         | He, Ne, Ar |
| Diatomic     | 2         | O₂, N₂, H₂ |
| Triatomic    | 3         | O₃, H₂O    |
| Tetra-atomic | 4         | NH₃        |
| Polyatomic   | ≥ 4       | CH₄, S₈    |

** Atomic mass unit:
here the mass of atom can not be measured in grams so for measuing we are having unit name as atomic mass unit:
1AMU=1/12 it is isotope of carbon:
it is denoted by mu
1amu= 1.66 * 10^ -27 kg

** molecular mass:
 it is the sum of molecule of all the masses of all atom in molecule of substance:
it is expressed in mu or amu earleir:
for eg atomic mass of hyderogen and oxygen are 1 and 16:
 so for water H2O the atomic mass will be 1*2+16 =18 so here 18 is molecular mass:

** valency:
 the combining capacity of an element is known as valency:
it tells how one element will combine with other:
valency of mag is 2 na is 1 cl is 1 carbon is 4
