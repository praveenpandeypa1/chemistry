**** Reactivity series:
Activity Series:

Potassium (K) > Sodium (Na) > Calcium (Ca) > Magnesium (Mg) > Aluminium (Al) > Zinc (Zn) > Iron (Fe) > Lead (Pb) > Copper (Cu) > Silver (Ag) > Gold (Au)
Key Points About Activity Series:

Most reactive metals (like K, Na, Ca) react vigorously with water and acids.

Moderately reactive metals (like Mg, Al, Zn, Fe) react slowly with acids and can displace less reactive metals from their salts.

Least reactive metals (like Cu, Ag, Au) do not react with water or acids under normal conditions.

Ag do not ract with oxygen in when heat and all:

**welding reaction:

1. Oxy-Acetylene Welding Reaction

The fuel used is acetylene (C₂H₂) and oxygen (O₂). The reaction produces a very hot flame (~3300°C) that melts the metal:

2𝐶2𝐻2 +5𝑂2 ⟶4𝐶𝑂2 +2𝐻2𝑂 +heat2C2H2+5O2⟶4CO2+2H2O+heat
Explanation:
Acetylene burns in oxygen → produces CO₂, H₂O, and a very hot flame.
The hot flame melts the edges of the metal pieces.
A filler rod may be added to form a strong joint.
2. Electric Arc Welding
Uses electric current to generate heat.
No chemical reaction, just metal melts due to electrical energy.
Example: Iron pieces join when arc melts edges.

***Thermite reaction:
Fe2O3 + Al = Fe + AL2O3 +Fe+ heat:
The thermite reaction is a highly exothermic reaction used for welding, cutting metals, and producing very high temperatures.
Explanation:
Ferric oxide (Fe₂O₃) reacts with aluminium (Al) powder.
Aluminium reduces Fe₂O₃ to iron (Fe).
The reaction produces aluminium oxide (Al₂O₃) and a huge amount of heat (~2500°C).
The molten iron produced can be used for welding railway tracks, heavy machinery parts.
Key Points:
It’s an example of a redox reaction:
Aluminium → oxidized (loses electrons)
Iron oxide → reduced (gains electrons)
Requires ignition by magnesium ribbon or high heat because it doesn’t start spontaneously.

** extraction of metals:
| **Reactivity**      | **Examples**      | **Extraction Method**                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |

2. Methods of Extraction
A. Electrolysis (for highly reactive metals)
Metals like Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al are extracted by electrolysis of molten compounds.
Why cryolite?
Lowers melting point and saves energy.

Ore: Natural mineral containing metal compounds.
Gangue: Impurities present in ore.
Flux: Substance (like limestone) used to remove gangue as slag.
Slag: Byproduct formed with flux and impurities.

extracting metals of middle in activity serieS:
zinc:
1) calicination: here heating of sulphide ore in the present of excess air  so at last we will get ZnO and SO2:
2)Roasting: here we heat the carbinate ore in less preseence of air: so we will get ZnO + CO2:

after getting the ZnO + C(coke) = Zn  + CO so we will get zinc + carbon monooxide:

Refining of Metals
Refining is the process of purifying crude metals obtained from ores to get metals of desired purity.

Process:
| **Method**                             | **Used For**             | **How It Works / Reaction**                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Distillation**                    | **Zinc, Mercury**        | Crude metal is **heated**, pure metal vaporizes and is condensed. Example: Zn → Zn vapor → Zn solid               |
| **2. Electrolytic Refining**           | **Copper, Silver, Gold** | Impure metal = anode, pure metal = cathode, electrolyte = solution of metal salt. Pure metal deposits at cathode. |
| **3. Liquation / Cupellation**         | **Tin, Lead, Silver**    | Impurities are **separated by melting point difference**. Example: Pb impure → melt → impurities float as slag    |
| **4. Poling / Refining with charcoal** | **Copper**               | Impure molten copper stirred with **green wood / charcoal** → oxidizes impurities → slag removed                  |
| **5. Zone Refining**                   | **Silicon, Germanium**   | Exploits **difference in solubility of impurities in solid & molten metal**. Used in semiconductors.              |

2. Important Points
Goal: Remove physical and chemical impurities.
Choice of method: Depends on metal type, impurities, and reactivity.
Electrolytic refining gives highest purity metals.

Corrosion
Definition:
Corrosion is the gradual destruction of metals due to chemical reactions with their environment, especially air and moisture.
Key Point:
Corrosion is a chemical or electrochemical process.
It mainly occurs in reactive metals like iron, copper, and aluminium

1. Example of Corrosion

Rusting of Iron:

4𝐹𝑒+3𝑂2+6𝐻2𝑂→4𝐹𝑒(𝑂𝐻)34Fe+3O2+6H2O→4Fe(OH)3
	​Fe(OH)₃ further dehydrates to form rust (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O).
Key Requirement:
Moisture (water) and oxygen are essential for rusting.

Prevention:
| **Method**              | **Explanation**                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Painting / Coating**  | Metal is covered with paint, varnish, or plastic to prevent contact with air/water           |
| **Galvanization**       | Coating iron with **zinc**. Zinc corrodes instead of iron (sacrificial protection)           |
| **Alloying**            | Making alloys like **stainless steel** (Fe + Cr + Ni) → more resistant to rust               |
| **Oiling / Greasing**   | Coating metal with oil or grease prevents water contact                                      |
| **Cathodic Protection** | Metal connected to **more reactive metal (Mg, Zn)** which corrodes instead of the main metal |

**Diff in both corrosion and rusting:
| **Corrosion**                                | **Rusting**                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Can occur in metals like Cu, Ag, Al          | Specific to iron and its alloys                   |
| May not require water                        | Requires water (moisture)                         |
| Leads to formation of oxides, sulfides, etc. | Formation of **hydrated iron oxide (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O)** |

1. Corrosion of Copper (Cu)

Observation:

Copper reacts slowly with air, moisture, and pollutants.

Forms a green layer called patina (mainly basic copper carbonate).

Reaction:

Copper reacts with oxygen and moisture:

2𝐶𝑢+𝑂2+𝐻2𝑂+𝐶𝑂2→𝐶𝑢(𝑂𝐻)2⋅𝐶𝑢𝐶𝑂32Cu+O2+H2O+CO2→Cu(OH)2⋅CuCO3
	Green layer: Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃ → protects underlying copper from further corrosion.
Key Points:
Slow corrosion, not as damaging as rusting.
Commonly seen on roofs, statues, and pipes.
Prevention:
Coating with lacquer, paint, or tin.
Avoid exposure to acidic and salty environment.

2. Corrosion of Silver (Ag)

Observation:

Silver tarnishes, forming a black layer of silver sulfide (Ag₂S).

Reaction:4𝐴𝑔+2𝐻2𝑆+𝑂2→2𝐴𝑔2𝑆+2𝐻2𝑂4Ag+2H2	​S+O2	​→2Ag2​S+2H2O
Key Points:
Tarnish occurs due to sulfur compounds in air (like H₂S).
Tarnish layer protects silver from further corrosion to some extent.
Prevention:
Keep silver dry and away from sulfur-containing compounds.
Use polishing, lacquering, or storing in airtight containers.

Doffrence in cososion in metals:

| **Metal**   | **Type of Corrosion** | **Product Formed** | **Damage Level**                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Iron (Fe)   | Rusting               | Fe₂O₃·xH₂O         | Very harmful, flakes off               |
| Copper (Cu) | Patina formation      | Cu(OH)₂·CuCO₃      | Protective, slows further corrosion    |

***Alloy
Definition:
An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-metal, designed to have improved properties like strength, corrosion resistance, or hardness.
| Silver (Ag) | Tarnishing            | Ag₂S               | Protective layer, cosmetic effect only |

Types of alloy:
| **Type**               | **Description**                    | **Examples & Uses**                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ferrous Alloys**     | Contain **iron as the main metal** | **Steel** (Fe + C) – strong and tough; **Stainless Steel** (Fe + C + Cr + Ni) – rust-resistant                                        |
| **Non-Ferrous Alloys** | Do **not contain iron**            | **Brass** (Cu + Zn) – corrosion-resistant, used in musical instruments; **Bronze** (Cu + Sn) – strong, used in statues and coins      |
| **Special Alloys**     | Designed for **specific purposes** | **Duralumin** (Al + Cu + Mn + Mg) – lightweight, used in aircraft; **Nichrome** (Ni + Cr) – high resistance, used in heating elements |

2. Advantages of Alloys
Stronger and harder than pure metals.
More resistant to corrosion and rusting.
Better electrical or thermal properties.
Can be designed for specific industrial purposes.

3. important examples:
| **Alloy**           | **Composition**   | **Use**                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Steel**           | Fe + C (0.2–2%)   | Construction, bridges, tools          |
| **Stainless Steel** | Fe + C + Cr + Ni  | Cutlery, surgical instruments         |
| **Brass**           | Cu + Zn           | Musical instruments, decorative items |
| **Bronze**          | Cu + Sn           | Coins, statues, bearings              |
| **Duralumin**       | Al + Cu + Mn + Mg | Aircraft, vehicles                    |
| **Nichrome**        | Ni + Cr           | Heating elements, toasters            |

Pure metals are often soft or weak, so alloys are made to improve properties.
The properties of alloys depend on the percentage of components.
Some alloys are non-metallic, e.g., steel containing carbon.
