ionic bond: the bond formed by the transfer of electron are ionic bond and the bond formed by the sharing is covalent bond: ionic bod also known as electrovalent bond:
eg: if we take an example of formation of O2  and Formation fo N2 and all here there is sharing of electron between  them so this is known as covalent bond:

so in most of the cases carbon form the bond by sharingof elctron in between them so this is covalent bond completly:

these things are happening just because to attain the inert gas property or to complete there outermost shell and all:

: some of the properties here:
1) covalent compund are formed between non metals and non metals:
eg: C N O S CL F BR: so here they will form in between them or single handedly and all: O2 H2 and H2O CO2 and all:

H2o is water:
NH3 is ammonia:
CH4 is methane:

**Carbon: it has overall 6 atomic no  so its valency will be 2 4 to attain the noble gas configuration and all it will require either loose or gain 4 electrons:
 carbon compund is always the covalent compund:

Properties of covalent compund:
1) low melting and boiling point:
2)poor conductor of electricity:

**IUPAC: internationol union for pure and applied chemistry:
1) meth eth prop but pent hex hept oct non dec:
methane= CH4  ethane = c2h6 propane: c3h8  butane: c4h10:
 this is the overall formula for making the task done:
so they are known as alkanes:

2) alkene:
 there is no methene as alkene always start from 2 carbon:
ethene: propene butene pentene hexene heptene octene  nonene decene:
C2H4 C3H6 C4H8 C5H10:

3)Alkyne: CnH2n-2 this is the formula for this:
  for alkyne like ethyne:

** functionol group: they give the chemical property of compound:
chloro bromo:
chloromethane: ch3cl  chloropropane c2h5cl:
 and so on:

OH group here add it to the last and make it using nol

like: methanol: ch3oh, ethanol: c2h5OH: and so on:

** aldehyde group here at last we just append al together and it gets the name as aldehyde group:
* for aldehyde group at last we used to add CHO 
for methanol: HCHO, CH2CHO:

** KETONE: HERE IT IS KETONE GROUP: SO FOR THIS THE MIN NO OF CARBON IT WILL NEED IS 3 SO ITS SERIES START FROM 3 MEANS PROP:
   AND ALSO IT GET ADDED IN MIDDLE AND IT IS KNOWN AS PROPANONE: BUTANONE, PENTANONE AND SO ON:

  * FOR OIC ACID: IT IS ALWAYS COOH: SO ADD AT LAST ONLY THAT: THESE ARE ALSO KNOWN AS CARBONXYLIX ACID:


  ** Homologous series: here homologus series basically consist of element of similar property together into single group and that is known as homologus group and so on:
   melting and boiling point increses as you move down the series and so on :
   chemical properties are same for homologus series and so on:

**ISOMERS: here we are having same molecular formula but diffrent branch structure so they are known as isomers and  so because for the same formula multiple structure are availble and so on:
diff type of isomerism that are possible and so on:===

| Type                              | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Chain Isomerism**            | Different arrangement of the **carbon skeleton** (straight or branched).                                      | n-butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃) and isobutane (CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃)   |
| **2. Position Isomerism**         | Same carbon skeleton & functional group, but **different position** of the functional group or multiple bond. | 1-butanol and 2-butanol / 1-butene and 2-butene              |
| **3. Functional Group Isomerism** | Same molecular formula but **different functional groups**.                                                   | Ethanol (C₂H₆O) and dimethyl ether (C₂H₆O)                   |
| **4. Metamerism**                 | Different **alkyl groups** attached to the same functional group (usually in ethers, amines, esters).         | Diethyl ether (C₂H₅OC₂H₅) and methyl propyl ether (CH₃OC₃H₇) |
| **5. Tautomerism**                | Dynamic equilibrium between two isomers differing by **position of H and a double bond**.                     | Keto–enol form: CH₃-CO-CH₂- → CH₂=CH-OH                      |

** saturated compound : all the compound that are having only carbon carbon single bond are saturated compound:
** unsaturated compound: all the compund that are having carbon carbon double and tripple bond are known as unsaturated compound:

** benzene= C6H6 this is the formula for benezen and so on:

** Ethanol: CH3CH2OH and Ethanoic acid: CH3- COOH:

 1) **Ethanol ka reaction:
   C2H5OH + Na = CH3CH2O NA + H2:
   when yo will heat ethano then you will get ethene + water:

2)Ethanioic acid ka reaction:
 CH3COOH + NaOh= CH3COONA + H20 this is what we will get:
CH3COOH + NAZCO3 = CH3COONA + CO2 + HZO
  CH3COOH + NAHCO3= CH3COONA + CO2+ H20 AND SO ON:


3)ESATERIFICATION: HERE WE ADD BOTH EATHANOL AND EATHNOIC ACID TOGETHER:
  THEY ARE USED IN MAKING PERFUMES AND FLAVORING AGENT AND SO ON:
  C2H5OH + CH3COOH = CH3COO C2H5 + H2O:
  so here the obtained substance CH3COO C2H5 it is known as easter and so on:

** ethanoic acid is also known as acetic acid and so on:

** Addition reaction: we are having addition reaction where we will combine all the alkene and alkyne together by hsing hyderogen to make alkane so this is known as addition reaction :
and here the process of adding hyderogen is known as hyderogenation:
 here for making unstaurated things to saturated we are using here hyderogenation process:

** Substitution reaction: the process of breaing the saturated in unstarurated is known as substitution reaction and so on:
* saturated compound are less reactive:

** Combustion: the process of buring any material is known as combustion in full supply of air:
 here after combustion the reaction and the reasukt i will get is CO2+ H20 + HEAT:


** ALLOTROPY : it is the phnomenon in which a compund exist two behavour means having diff chemical and physical behaivour is known as allotropy and so on:
Carbon exits in diff form in nature:
graphite: diamond:

** Soaps: molecules of soaps are salts of potassium or sodium  salts of long chain 
here 15 -17 carbon ki chain hogi and at last we will attach COONA:
hydrophobic: the remaing part that do not get involved in water is known as hydrophobic and the COONA part get invoved in water hydrphilic:
