Atom is divisble  it basically consist of electron proton and nutron :
here electron is negtaively charge, proton is poistively charge and nutron is nutrel
electron revolve around nucleus in fixed orbit:
where as nucleus consist of proton + nuetron:
year 1932:

** Canal rays: 
as it was discoverd in year 1886 by GOLDSTIEN:
THERE inside the tube there was positive charge coming out with gas in canal so this was called as canal rays:
canal rays are made of positively charged partcles called: Anode rays:
canal rays were the one who lead to the discovery of proton:
Gas at low pressure and high voltage:

** Cathode rays:
it was discvred in 1897 by JJ THOMSON:
here negative charge was camong out of negative charge plate thats why they were called as cathode rays: and moving towarsd postive charge:
gas at low pressure and high voltage:
that negatively charged particles that were coming out they were called as electrons:

** THOMSON MODEL OF ATOM: watermelon
 here the red part is proton and seed spread across they are electrons:
 means the seed or electrons are embedde inside the atom:
 he give this model in 1904
 two main:
  the electrons are embedde there in sphere:
   the negative and positive charge are equal in magnitude so the whole atom is negative:
   this modl was failed  in various experienments perfoemd by rutherford: gold foil experiments:

** rutherfod alpha particle scattering experiment: 1909
alpha particle: a double charged helium ion:
mass = 4u fast moving:

here inside experiments he take one very high beam alpha particle rays and beam it on GOLD FOIL  so few observation he got:
1) 90 percent of alpha particle passed throug the gold foil straight:
2)some of the alpha partcle deflected by small angle:
3)very few out of 1 in 12000 deflected by 180 degree

so hew reached conclusion and he suggested the four observatin:
1) here 99 perecnt light passes means the most of space is emty in atom:
2) here few alpha light diflected means there proton but its in very center and accmulated in nuvleus:
3)the size of nucleus is 10^5 small than atom:
4)mass concentrated in nucleus since the few light deficled with 180 degree means there is something very hard than alpha particle light that is all:

RUTHERFORD MODEL OF ATOM:
1) Here whole mass is inside nuclues:
2)electron revolve around nuclues:
3) the size of nucleus is very small as compared to the size of atoms:

** drawbacks: it didnt explaine dth stabilty:
1) here any charge particle in accelerated looses energy in from of radiatoon:
2)electron revlove around circle so its direction velocity is changing rapidly hence it is accelerated:
3) so a revloving electron loose energy in the form of radiation in very cycle at last fall in nucleus:
4)the stom should be highly  unstable and matter would not exits:
but we know atom ar stablE:

** BOHRS MODEL OF ATOM: 1913:
NEILS BOHRS
here in his model electron revolve around nucleus in fixed orbit and each orbit has its fixed ebergy and each orbit name as k l m n and sol all and 1 2 3 4 so on
and here poistively charged nucleus is at center:

** Discover of neutrons: 1932 and updated atomic model
in 1932 james chadwik discvred nuetrons:
neutrons has 0 charge:
mass of nutrons is nearly equal to that of protons:
neutrins are present in nucleus along with proton and form nucleus:

electron 9.1* 10^-31  jj thomson

proton 1.6* 10 ^-27    rutherford

neutron: 1.6* 10^-27    james chadwik:


** ATOMIC NUMBER(Z) ELEMENT KI PEHCHAN:
Z= the total no of protons is atomic number:
for nuetro, atom Z= no of electrons= no of protons:

** the max no of electron present in partcular orbit is 2N^2 like 1st orbit is 2 2nd oerbit 4 3rd orbit is 8 4th orbit is 32:
  so these are representing the orbit and number of electrons in that level:
  there can not be more than 8 electrons in the last cell of each orbit bhale is uski capacity jyada ho:
  for eg: chlorine: 17 atomic no: here 17 electron and 17 proton  so its octet will be 2 8 7


  ** electronic configuration:
  the arangemeno of electrons at various shells in atomic configuartion is known as shells:
  valence shell: it is outemost shell:
  valance electron: the electron preseent in the outermost shell or known as valence electron:

  ** octet rule:
   if there is 8 electron in outermost shell of an atom then they are stable and balance and less reactive:
   eg: neon 2, 8
   argon: 2, 8 ,8:
   so here every element want to achive this octet of 8 and want to bet stable :

   valency: the number of electron obtained, donated, or shared to complete the valency or octet of 8 is known as valency:
   when atom loose or form ions they formed charged ions:
   if its donate the elctron then it will be +ve and if it will take electron then negative:

** MASS NUMBER:
it is denoted by A: no of protons+ no of neutrons:
is known as nucleons:
* and you know that atomic number Z is no of electrons= no of protons and all:

** Isotopes: here atomic no of element same but mass no diffrent: 
here one element can have diffrent diffrent mass no:
eg: 1H1 1H2 1H3 AND so on:
i) an isotope of uranium is used as fuel in nuclear reactor:
ii)an isotope of cobalt is used in treatment of cancer:
iii) an isotope of iodine is used in treatment of goitre:

** ISOBARS:
they are having diffrent diffrent atomic numbers but same mass number here eg: 18ar40 and 18ca40 both are same:
