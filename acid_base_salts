**Acid: it is the substance that gives only H+ ion in aquous solution is known as acid:
it has sour taste: khatta
it turns the blue litmus red:
eg: hcl, h2so4, ch3COOH acetic acid vinegar, nitric acid(HNO3)

**  Bases: it is the substance that give OH- io in aquos solution
here in base it turns the red litmus blue:
it has bitter taste:
soapy in touch:
eg: sodium hyderoxide, calcium hyderoxide,potatsium hyderoxide and so on:

**Indicators: it tells us that weather the given substance is acid or base:
there are 4 type of indicators:

indicators:             base        acid:
litmus                  blue          red
turmeric:               red          yellow
phenolepthlin           pink         colourless
methylo orange:         yellow       red

*** simple method to learn is :  labour try popcorn with mayor:

**OLFACTORY indicators: substance whoose smell changes in acidic or basic medoum or known as olfactry indicators:
retains smell in acid medium:       looses smell in basic medium:
eg: onion , vanila esscence, clove oil:

**Acid in water:
acid solution produce H+ ion in water:
HCL IS PASSES IN WATER THEN IT WILL PRODUCE h+ and CL- ion :
H2SO4 IS PASSES THROUGH WATER IT WILL PRODUCE H+ ION SO4:

H+ of acid combine with water to produce hydeonium ion H3O+

**Preparation of HCL gas:

NACL+ H2SO4= NASO4+ HCL: nacl is sodium chloride and H2SO4 is sulphuric acid and naso4 fro sodium sulphate and HCL hydro chloric acid:

when you pass HCL with dry litmus then there will be no change:
but when you pass HCL(G) to moist litmus it turns the blue litmus red:
HCL+ H2O= H3O+ CL-

**BASE IN WATER:
here bases will increase the hydroxide ion in water:

eg: NAOH =NA + OH
KOH= K+OH
MG(OH)2= MG+ OH-

**SOME bases are water soluble and that bases are called alkali:
naoh koh nh4oh are more soluble and mgoh  caoh and these are less or partially soluble:


** diluting an acid:
here mixing concentrated acid with water is known as diluting an acid:
acid+ water is highly exothermic

here when you add water to acid then it will produce a lot of heat and cause burn and many things :
so always add acid to water slowly:


acid and alkalis they both consist of ions so they so they generate the current and so on:
 where as gloucose: C6H12O6 alcohol C2H5OH they dont contain ions so they do not carry current or charge:

** reaction with metal:

metal + acid= salt + hydrogen gas:
Zn + H2SO4= ZnSO4(white vitriol)+ H2 
metal above hydrogen in activity series displace hydrogen as gas:


** reaction with base:
metal + base= salt + hydrogen gas:
Zn + H2SO4 = ZnSO4 + H2

** reaction dose not happen with all metal in case of base:
reaction of metal carbonate with acid:

acid+ metal carbonate = salt + co2+ water:
HCL + NA2CO3 =NACL + CO2+ HCL:

** TEST FOR CO2:
 when you pass carbon di oxide with lime water it will change the lime water into milky:
and excess of carbon di oxidemake disapper that milky and all:

**Neutrlisation reaction:
ACID+ BASE = SALT + WATER:
HCL+ NAOH = NACL+ H2O

** Reaction of metal oxide with acid is salt and  water:   CU + HCL= CUcl+ H2O
** reaction of non metal oxide with base will give salt and water:  CO2+ CAOH2= CACO3 + H20

** strength of acid and base: it is measuerd by PH scale:
 here string acid will give more H+ ion like  Hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid:
 strong base: it will give in large amount the hydroxide ion eg: naoh, caoh2 , KOH:
weak acid like: acetic , lactic , carboinc they will give less h+ ion:
weak base : they will give less OH- ion so weak base:

**PH scale:it test and check weather the given solution is acidic or basic:
PH SCALE= it is  from 0 to 14:
0-6 it is acid:
7= neutral:
8-14 is base 
 here 0 is more acidic and 6 is low acidic:
7 is neutral:
8 is less basic
and 14 is more basic:

the acidic clour for this will be red orange and yellow: 
greeen means neutral:
B I V means basic:

** PH range for Human body is 7.0 to 7.8 
PH value less than 5.6 of rain then it is acidic rain:
stomach also produces acid:

** PH<5 then tooth decay so here toothpaste neytralise that accessa acid:

PH for salts:
1) strong acid+ string base = neytral salt + water and here PH is 7:
2)weak acid + strong base= basic salt + water : here PH>7
3) strong acid+ weak base = acidc salt + water here PH<7

naturally occuring acids:
